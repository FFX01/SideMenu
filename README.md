# SideMenu
A small sidemenu element for HTML webpages utilizing jquery.

SideMenu.html contains a basic html document containing the base elements required for the menu to work properly.

SideMenuStyle.css contains the basic styling elements for the menu.

SideMenuScript.js contains one simple jquery function that makes the menu responsive.

I will continue updating this module/plugin as I (hopefully) get better at developing.
